## Boost.GIL

1. Selection of image processing algorithms

* Student: [Miral Shah](https://github.com/miralshah365)
* Mentor:  [Mateusz Loskot](https://github.com/mloskot)

The goal of this project is to add to GIL selection of core algorithms
used in the image processing and analysis techniques Miral proposed to
implement algorithms from the following categories:

    * thresholding
    * channels normalization 
    * morphological image processing
    * noise filtering
    * convolutions

## Boost.Geometry

* Student: [Tinko Bartels](https://github.com/tinko92)
* Mentors: [Vissarion Fisikopoulos](https://github.com/vissarion), [Adam Wulkiewicz](https://github.com/awulkiew)

The goal of this projest is twofold. First, implement algorithms 
for computing the Delaunay triangulation and (the dual structure) 
Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Second, implement algorithms 
for random point generation (according to some given distribution,
e.g. uniform) in a geometry.
