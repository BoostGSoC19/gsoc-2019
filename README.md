## Boost.GIL

1. Selection of image processing algorithms

* Student: [Miral Shah](https://github.com/miralshah365)
* Mentor:  [Mateusz Loskot](https://github.com/mloskot)

The goal of this project is to add to GIL selection of core algorithms
used in the image processing and analysis techniques Miral proposed to
implement algorithms from the following categories:

    * thresholding
    * channels normalization 
    * morphological image processing
    * noise filtering
    * convolutions
